fs_logger.pl & Misc Tools for FreeSWITCH
=================================



OVERVIEW
-----
A repo for various tools and samples developed for FreeSWITCH.

- fs_logger.pl - a log capture, submission, and obfuscation tool that wraps (and can be used as a direct interface for) fs_cli.  Full details at https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Fs_logger.pl
- SampleClient - a .net client example for using FreeSWITCH lib with .net and Windows.  It is a sample for creating a softphone like FSClient (https://github.com/mitchcapper/FSClient) or just as a good starting point for embedded FreeSWITCH
- missing_modules.pl - simple perl script to look for any modules missing between perl installs, useful if you need to recompile perl for threading or similar for FreeSWITCH
